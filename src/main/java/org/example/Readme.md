### Debugging

### Why we need debugging
- Find and fix the bug or to create a nice internal issue
- Code analysing
  - Getting familiar with new code base
  - Understand the flow
- Change the behaviour of the code
  - Reproduce a complicated setup
  - Change the methods variable and simply anything on the fly
